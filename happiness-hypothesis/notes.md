# The Happiness Hypothesis

by Jonathan Haidt

## Notes:

## Chapter 1: The Divided Self

> For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want. St Paul, Galatians 5:171

### The metaphors of human thinking

_Plato_ described the human mind as a rider of a chariot with two horses. The horse on the right bares a noble and decent temperment. This horse loves honor, virtue and restraint and requires no whip. The horse on the left is an indecent beast: shaggy and deaf. Whipping the left creature into submission feels nearly impossible.

_Freud_ Horse, buggy, rider and driver. The driver (ego) tries to control the wild disobedient horse (id), while the passenger (superego) spurns the driver with orders.

_Bhudda & Haidt_ the elephant and the rider. The elephant is all intuition and habit. The rider is not able to directly control the elephant, but can teach it to react appropriately over time. The elephant decides what is good, bad, ugly or beautiful. The rider creates reasoning to back up the choices of the elephant. However, the rider can over time retrain the elephant to have different decisions.
